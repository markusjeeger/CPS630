							Hello! My name is Markus Jeeger and this is my first reactive webpage. It uses the 
							<a href="https://www.awwwards.com/web-design-awards/dream-team-katarzyna-konkowska">Dream Team Katarzyna Konkowska By BrightMedia</a> colour scheme,
							and a format based loosely inspired by news and social media sites, but not all white. Read through the page to learn more about me, 
							and be sure to check out my resume page, and some tech news.

						<h4>Scouting </h4>
						I am involved with the Toronto Estonian Scouts, where I am the leader of the Venture program for boys aged 14-17. Some of the activities we do include
						the basics of knots, knives, and other camping skills. We also do shooting with both bows and guns, and go on long outdoor adventures such as a 4 day canoe
						trip to Algonquin Park.

						<h4>Gaming </h4>
						I am a big fan of video games, and spend a lot of my time playing them. Some of my favourites are World of Warcraft, the Dragon Age series, and the 
						Civilization series. I think video games are a great way to pass time as they are fun, challenging, and keep you engaged, practicing your problem 
						solving and quick thinking skills.

						<h4>Computer Science </h4>
						I have been studying computer science since grade 10 in high school, and am now in my last year of computer science at Ryerson. I have enjoyed learning
						more about it and developing my programing skills in many languages. I am in the process of finding a job for when I graduate.
