						A preview of an Apple News subscription service was found in a developer build of iOS 12.2 by 9to5Mac today, 
						and the service would offer access to newspapers and magazines for a monthly fee. The images line up with The New York Times 
						report from last October that reported Apple is close to launching its own subscription service inside the News app, 
						and it builds on Apple’s acquisition of a digital magazine subscription service called Texture, which was billed as the 
						“Netflix of magazines,” earlier last year...

						WhatsApp and Instagram are to be integrated with Facebook Messenger, it has been revealed. 
						Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apparently wants to combine the services under a single underlying messaging platform or protocol.
						The idea is to allow users to communicate across the three services more easily, with the project set to complete 
						by the end of this year or early next, according to The New York Times.
						According to reports, the new unified backend will support the end-to-end encryption needed to stop messages being 
						viewed by third parties...

						A Rogers forum member has revealed the Android update schedule for several popular devices, including the Pie update for the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, 
						S9 and S9+. The upgrade schedule, shared by Community Manager Darrell, lists various updates, including the December, January and February security patches, 
						as well as Pie updates for a few devices. Before we get into the dates, it’s important to remember that they could change. 
						Darrell notes as much in his forum post, saying that “sometimes things change beyond our control.” For example, 
						a bug may be discovered that causes a delay in the update schedule.
